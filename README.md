This project compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the Fashion MNIST dataset. It evaluates three ANN architectures (Shallow, Deeper, Very Deep) and three CNN architectures (Basic, Medium, Advanced) based on accuracy, overfitting, and training efficiency. Results show CNNs outperform ANNs, with the tuned Basic CNN achieving 99.09% test accuracy. The report highlights CNNs' strength in capturing spatial features and the critical role of hyperparameter tuning. Includes detailed analysis of model architectures, training dynamics, and tuning impacts.
